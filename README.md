# A-star-Search-Algorithm
This project is to find the shortest distance between 2 nodes in a graph. 
The algorithm works in minimizing the sum of path travelled and estimated
distance to the distance. The distance is calculated using L2 norm between 2 points.


The files used in the project are as follows:

### **1. project_notebook** ###

This is the heart of the project which has all the function definition and path visualization.
My project was to define the relevant data structures for various parameters.

### **2. helpers.py** ###

This defines the map class, which has the relevant functions for defining the map. There are two kinds
of maps, one having 10 nodes and one having 40 nodes. Also, it has two dictionaries defining the co-ordinates
of nodes in respective maps.

### **3. test.py** ###

This file tests whether the project is executed successfully and gives the relevant feedback.

## Feedback requested: ##

I would love to explore more maps having more number of points. I am open to collaborating for the same. Also, 
reqest your feedback on improving the code, making it more concise and efficient.
